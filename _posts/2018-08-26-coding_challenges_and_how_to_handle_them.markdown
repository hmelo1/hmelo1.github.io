Over the course of the last few weeks I've gotten quite a large number of coding challenges. Some on HackerRank and some just e-mailed directly to you. 

The HackerRank ones are usually 30-90 minutes to solve a specific set of problems. These are usually automated and you get a response back the same day or next day to schedule an on-site. (At least in my experience). 

Best tips I can come up with:
* Understand the question as best as possible.
* Submit/run your tests often. They're your friend!
* Make sure all the preexisting tests are passing. 
* Stay calm. You've got this.

The other kind normally take a few hour and are a challenge to see your coding style and your process. 
Best tips I can come up for these kinds:
* Document your work. Keep comments and make sure to keep that READme awesome looking. Explain the choices you've made. 
* Create tests and test those edge cases!
* Stick to Object Oriented Program. Seperate those methods and keep the code DRY.
* A sneaky tip I've discovered is to leave a test or two failing. Most interviews I've had that go with this style of test will do a pair programming with you. This'll give you somehing small to work on while you're working on reformatting with your pairee.

Once you've submitted your challenge you're on to the next step! Hopefully you get a reply quick so you're not stuck biting your nails waiting for a reply.
