This project was a bit of a doozy. I had to flip through some of the previous labs such as the Fwitter (Oh man, THIS HELPED A TON). That gave me a good basis on how to set everything up. I felt pretty confident with the project while I was creating it. When I "finished" the project I was super proud of myself. Except, there was one glaring issue. It was pretty barebones and kind of ugly. I fiddled around for a few hours with it before getting the bright idea of trying to use a Javascript Bootstrap.

Then came the hard party. Morphing the Bootstrap into something useable with my application. There were a few hiccups along the way, especially with trying to figure out how to setup the Layout.erb file to change the masthead on every page.
