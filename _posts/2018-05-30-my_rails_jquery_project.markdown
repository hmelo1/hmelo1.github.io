I always learn a ton when going through these portfolio projects. This time around I got to use Paperclip, Amazon AWS to upload the pictures to cloud storage, and of course a bit of Jquery. Rails can feel a bit like magic sometimes. That magic gets shattered when you have to throw in some Javascript/AJAX. Man-oh-man, was doing this project withoure remote: true rough. Almost all of the documentation online suggests doing it this way. By all-in-all I think my project turned out great. I love the formatting of it and would totally use it if it were a real site. I'll continue working on it and see where it goes from here.
