"I am neither especially clever nor especially gifted. I am only very, very curious." - Albert Einstein

That quote has always stood out to me. My entire life I've never been exceptionally good at anything. I've learned to play the guitar, learned to play the piano, speak french, learn to not be bad at most video games, and now I'm learning to become a software developer. I'm not particularly amazing at any of the things I've listed but I always work my hardest and enjoy learning new things. 

"I'll never be the next Jimmy Hendrix, but damnit my dog enjoys listening to me play." - Me
