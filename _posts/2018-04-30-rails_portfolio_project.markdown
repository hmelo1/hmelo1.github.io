This project caused me a bit of a headache. But its a fun addition to my toolbelt. 

# Few Gems I learned
**1. Devise**: Builds flexible authentication and is based on Warden. Builds up a great signup and login process for you as well saving you from alot of redundant work.
**2. OAuth**: Built off Devise and allows you to use another website's authentication process. Had a bit of a rough time triyng to set it up via Twitter so I used Google instead for mine.
**3. Bootstrap**: My new favorite gem. Allowed me to use a bootstrap theme I loved.
