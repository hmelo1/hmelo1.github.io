Oh boy, I struggled with this alot more than I should've. For some reason I just couldn't wrap my head around setting up rails to be a backend API for Rails. At first Redux seemed terrifying, but once I heard that "click" everything just started to fall into place. 

My Project is my eventual menu for my dream restraurant.

# The Backend

The backend for my project is built on Ruby on Rails. Its only responsible for database related quieries and ended up being alot easier to set up than I though. 

A few models for: User, Recipe, and Ingredients.

# The Frontend
Personally, this is where I had the most fun. I love seeing the little components make something bigger. Its like playing with lego blocks! ![](https://i.imgur.com/HwXl8fE.gifv)

I felt fairly comfortable with states and components. But Redux threw me for a bit of a loop with reducers, actions and containers. But my app turned out awesome!
