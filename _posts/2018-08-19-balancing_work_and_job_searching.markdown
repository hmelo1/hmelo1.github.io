Job searching and intervieiwng at the same time is a struggle. Even worse when you're trying to making a career shift, maintain some semblance of competancy at work and not let your employer know you're considering quitting. Job searching is never easy, and its not much easier when you're jobless. But that's a different kind of issue.  But if you're looking for a job while currently working one. Just remember, don't search for a job on a work computer. Don't work on your resume either. And especially don't use your work email while applying for a new job. 

Just a few tips to help out my fellow students having the same problems:

1. Try not to schedule your phone interviews while you're at work unless you've got your own office or a server room to hide in (in my case).
2. Only give in your notice when you've accepted a final offer. Think about how much it would suck to quit your job and just have your new job suddenly rescind the offer.
3. Quit your job gracefully and give in some notice. Every day since I've graduated Flatiron I've wanted to slam my ID, key-fob, and company equipment down on the table and scream "I quit". I know how it feels, hold on just a little longer.
4. Try not to tell your co-workers you're looking for a new job. Sometimes that office gossip spreads like wild fire and you don't want to let the wrong people know you're looking around. 
5. Schedule you're time well. I work an odd shift and have Mondays and Tuesdays off. Most people don't have this luxury. Plan each and every step of your job hunt. Days you apply, days you interview, the occasional happy hour with friends, etc. Make sure you spend your time well!

Those are the best tips I can think of. Chin up though, hopefully, you'll have you're dream job soon!
